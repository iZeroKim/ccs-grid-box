                <p>Covid-19 is a novel virus, which means it was previously unknown until the current outbreak. Therefore, a lot of its qualities are still unknown. It has been shown that high temperatures and high humidity may reduce transmission of the
                    virus. However, Australia, South America and Africa have all reported confirmed cases of Covid-19 despite the warmer temperatures at this time of year. In addition to climatic conditions, other factors that affect transmission include
                    population density and the quality of medical care.</p>

                <p>Clean the hands regularly with an alcohol-based sanitizer, or wash them with soap and water. The CDC also make this recommendation, advising that sanitizer should contain “at least 60% alcohol” and that people should wash their hands for
                    at least 20 seconds. Clean surfaces — such as kitchen seats and work desks — regularly with disinfectant. Avoid crowded areas when going out, for people over 60 years old and people with any underlying health problems.</p>
